# Library-System
This Library system written in the Java programming language for a second year college project. The system consist of a GUI 
interface to allow the user borrow, return and reserve books. The interface has two login types, user and admin. The user can
search through the connect SQL database (Database creation script included) for which ever book they require. If the desired 
book is unavailable, the user can reserve the book for when it is returned. The system can also calculate late fees on any 
books returned late. 
The admin login allows the adding, deleting, editing of all books available in the system. They can also add, remove and edit
user profiles. The canceling of late fees is also possible.
